Description:
This project is an implementation of symmetric cryptography using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with a 128-bit key, developed using Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework. The implementation provides the capability to securely encrypt and decrypt data using AES128 through a simple and user-friendly web interface.

Key Features:

1. AES128 Encryption/Decryption: Provides functionality to perform encryption and decryption using AES with a 128-bit key.
2. Flask Web Interface: Intuitive web interface that allows users to easily input text or files for encryption and receive decryption results.
3. Secure Communication: Uses the HTTPS protocol to ensure security during communication between the client and server.
4. Code Simplicity: Clean code structure and comprehensive documentation, enabling developers to understand and extend the project easily.
 Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running the command pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the application with the command python app.py.
4.Open the application in a web browser and access the provided user-friendly interface.
5. This project aims to provide a cryptography solution easily accessible through a web interface, offering users the convenience of securing and safeguarding their data using AES128. Feel free to explore and contribute to enhancing this project!
